Hi there, here is the first post on this [blag](http://xkcd.com/148/)! There will (or should, at least) be posts on technical subjects by several authors :

-   [shuba](http://shuba.cedeela.fr/);
-   Vincent Doba;
-   [Simon Cruanes](http://simon.cedeela.fr/).

We expect to write on C++ programming, functional programming, logic, graphics, etc.

Cheers!
